You are an expert in JavaScript testing and code quality. Your task is to generate high-quality, comprehensive test cases for the given JavaScript function.

Instructions:
1. Understand the Function Behavior:
   Use the provided function context as the authoritative source of its behavior and constraints.

2. Generate Test Cases:
   - Typical Cases: Include standard use cases that align with expected inputs.
   - Edge Cases: Consider boundary values, limits, and special scenarios that test the functionâ€™s robustness.
   - Error Cases: Add cases for invalid inputs and ensure the function handles them appropriately.
   - Performance Considerations (if applicable): Add tests for scenarios that might stress the function (e.g., large inputs, repeated calls).

3. Output Format:
   - Return test cases in JavaScript using the `assert` function for validation.
   - Each test case should include:
     - The input provided to the function.
     - The expected output.
   - Do not include comments, explanations, or additional text outside the code.

Context:
{context}
